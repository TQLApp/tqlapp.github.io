# Terms of Service

## Acceptance of Terms

By using the TQL app, you agree to the terms of service covered here, the MIT
license (see below) and [Privacy Policy](Privacy-policy.md). These three
documents constitute the entire agreement between the TQL team and the users.

## Description of Service

The purpose of the TQL app is to provide the user with advanced search
capabilities using APIs the user provides access to. Search features are
implemented using plugins. The app allows the user to install third party
plugins ("unverified"). These plugins are not covered by this Terms of Service.
When you install a third party plugin, you are notified in the app that you are
doing so. Using these plugins is at your own risk and the TQL team is not
responsible for any issues that arise from using these.

## User Responsibilities

It's the users responsibility to take care of their data. The TQL app itself
handles the users data with care. No data or credentials are ever made available
to the TQL team. The only way this data leaves the users device is to
authenticate with services the user has configured (e.g. account credentials to
authenticate with a service), or to backup providers like Google Drive. If you
decide to copy any data yourself, e.g. as part of a support ticket or for any
other reasons, it's your responsibility that this is done responsibly.

## Governing Law

This Terms of Service is governed by Dutch law.

## Amendments to Terms of Service

The Terms of Service can be updated if deemed necessary. You will be notified of
this in the app using an in-app notification. This notification will link to the
current version of the Terms of Service.

## Severability and Waiver

If any part of the Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable, the rest of
the document still remains in effect. Failure to enforce any part of the Terms
of Service does not constitute a waiver of those terms.
